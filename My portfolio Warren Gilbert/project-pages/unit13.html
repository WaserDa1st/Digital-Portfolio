        <div class="body-text">The purpose of this unit is to know how websites are made and to learn the many different elements that build up a website like the text, animation and graphics and if itâ€™s an advanced website it can also contain features such as online purchasing and messaging and database search facilities. We also investigated the features and uses of websites by analysing what they are and how they use each of the elements in the website.</div>
